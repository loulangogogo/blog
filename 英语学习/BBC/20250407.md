"Asia is bearing the brunt of the US tariff hike. While there could be some room for negotiation, a new regime of higher tariffs are here to stay," Qian Wang, Asia Pacific chief economist at investment firm Vanguard.

"This is negative to the global and Asia economy, especially those small open economies, both in the short term and long term."

Countries from Vietnam to Bangladesh have become highly-reliant on the US as an export market.

All three major US stock indexes in fell by more than 5%, with the S&P 500 dropping almost 6%, capping the worst week for the US stock market since 2020.
