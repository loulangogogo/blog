It was on the ==corner== of the street that he noticed the first sign of something ==peculiar== – a cat reading a map.For a second,Mr Dursley didn't realise what he had seen – then he ==jerked== his head around to look again.There was a ==tabby== cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive,but there wasn't a map in ==sight==.What could he have been thinking of?It must have been a ==trick== of the light.Mr Dursley ==blinked== and ==stared== at the cat.It stared back.As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up the road,he watched the cat in his mirror.It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive – no,looking at the sign;cats couldn't read maps or signs.Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind.As he drove ==towards== town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.

But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get-ups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt – these people were obviously collecting for something… yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind back on drills.
