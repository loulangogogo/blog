Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such ==nonsense==.

Mr Dursley was the ==director== of a ==firm== called Grunnings, which made ==drills==. He was a big, ==beefy== man with ==hardly== any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was ==thin== and ==blonde== and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time ==craning== over ==garden== ==fences==, ==spying== on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no ==finer== boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could ==bear== it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for ==several== years; in fact, Mrs Dursley ==pretended== she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys ==shuddered== to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the ==dull==, grey Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley ==hummed== as he ==picked out== his most boring ==tie== for work and Mrs Dursley ==gossiped== away happily as she ==wrestled== a ==screaming== Dudley into his high chair.
